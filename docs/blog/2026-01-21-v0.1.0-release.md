## What's New

### Interactive Wizard

Just run `ralph-starter` with no arguments:

```bash
ralph-starter
```

The wizard guides you through:
1. Describing your project idea
2. Refining it with AI
3. Customizing the tech stack
4. Building it automatically

No command-line expertise required!

### Idea Mode

Don't know what to build? We've got you covered:

```bash
ralph-starter ideas
```

Choose from four discovery methods:
- **Brainstorm with AI** - Creative suggestions
- **Trending ideas** - Based on current tech trends
- **Based on my skills** - Personalized to what you know
- **Solve a problem** - Solutions for pain points

### Input Sources

Fetch specs from your existing tools:

```bash
ralph-starter run --from github --project owner/repo --label "ready"
ralph-starter run --from linear --label "sprint-1"
ralph-starter run --from notion --project "Product Specs"
```

Also supports URLs and PDFs.

### MCP Integration

Use ralph-starter from Claude Desktop or any MCP client:

```bash
ralph-starter mcp
```

Available tools: `ralph_init`, `ralph_plan`, `ralph_run`, `ralph_status`, `ralph_validate`.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install -g ralph-starter
ralph-starter
```

That's it! The wizard will guide you from there.

## What's Next

We're planning:
- VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf extension
- TUI dashboard mode
- More input source integrations
